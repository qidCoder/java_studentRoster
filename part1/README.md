**Tasks:**

● Have a method handler in the controller for the following example url: ```/students/create?firstName=John&lastName=Doe&age=35```. Create 4 students with this method.

● Have a method handler in the controller for the following example url: ```/contacts/create?student=1&address=1234%20Some%20Street&city=Los%20Angeles&state=CA```. The ```student``` query parameter should be the id of the student in the database. Create the contact info for the students from the previous task. (```%20``` is the encoding for SPACE in query parameters)

● Have a method handler in the controller for the following example url: ```/students```. Print all the students information along with their contact information in the console.
